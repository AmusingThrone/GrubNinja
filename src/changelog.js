      "GrubNinja is finally public! Version 1.0.2 brings many new changes to the table. I originally started this project as a private cheat to give out to friends, however its expanded greatly since then. This official release of GrubNinja includes many new changes and features. I know i've been teasing a secret feature in the discord, so I guess i'll spit it. I have managed to implement a map bypass for the generator. This means that anyone that does not have access to a specific map pack in Grub Guardian will be able to generate rewards from any map they want. This includes both Wysteria for the energy elixirs, as well as the hoard packs from the Azteca map pack. Additonally, reward generator speeds have been cut tremendously. Generating rewards no longer depend on active game states, therefore rewards are able to be generated at an incredibly fast rate. Additional improvements include speed enhancements on the pet trainer, as well as significant UI updates. Need to use an energy elixir after training your pet? GrubNinja now includes a quick launcher\" for Wizard101 which can be accessed via Settings. This feature is only available via Windows. If you have any suggestions or concerns, you can DM me in the GrubNinja discord server. Thanks, Tides."
